I’m Tianhui, originally from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China and currently pursuing my Master’s in Bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen. Now I’m working on my thesis at DTU, which involves developing prediction models for TCR-peptide binding. This research is pivotal for advancing treatments for tumors and other immune-related diseases, areas that I am deeply passionate about.</p> <p>When I’m not immersed in research, you’ll likely find me on the badminton or ping-pong court with friends. I also have a sweet spot for baking—I’m pretty good at making cakes and love sharing them with others. In my downtime, I enjoy drawing and sharing my artwork on Instagram. As a proud cat person, I’m eagerly looking forward to adopting a feline friend soon!</p> <p>If my research interests resonate with you or you’d just like to connect, feel free to drop me an email or follow me on LinkedIn. I’m always excited to meet new people and engage in meaningful conversations!</p> <h2 id="motto">Motto</h2> <p>“Take immediate action rather than overthinking—the best way to predict the future is to create it.”</p> <h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2> <ul> <li>Bioinformatics</li> <li>Data Science</li> <li>Cancer and Immunology</li> <li>Multi-modal Data Analysis</li> <li>Deep Learning and Language Models</li> </ul> </body></html>
