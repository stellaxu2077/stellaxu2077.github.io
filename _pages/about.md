## Biography

Hello! I'm Tianhui, originally from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China and currently pursuing my Master's in Bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen. Now I'm working on my thesis at DTU, which involves developing prediction models for TCR-peptide binding. This research is pivotal for advancing treatments for tumors and other immune-related diseases, areas that I am deeply passionate about.

When I'm not immersed in research, you'll likely find me on the badminton or ping-pong court with friends. I also have a sweet spot for baking—I'm pretty good at making cakes and love sharing them with others. In my downtime, I enjoy drawing and sharing my artwork on Instagram. As a proud cat person, I'm eagerly looking forward to adopting a feline friend soon!

If my research interests resonate with you or you'd just like to connect, feel free to drop me an email or follow me on LinkedIn. I'm always excited to meet new people and engage in meaningful conversations!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
